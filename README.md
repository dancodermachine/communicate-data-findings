# Korea Coronavirus Patients - Update 2020
### by Daniel Villanueva

## Dataset

The data consists of data of approximately 3326 patients, including state, sex, age, and other characteristics. The data can be found on the Kaggle website on the following link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset), with feature documentation available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/ds4c-what-is-this-dataset-detailed-description).

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, it was found that most people got infected by being in contact with someone else (872 people). The second source of infection is people who got infected in other country (475 people). After that, people got infected by attending places where concentration of people existed (e.g. call centers, churches).

It was found also that more women than men were infected and that older infected women can resist more than infected men. On average infected women died at age 81, however, infected men on average died at 66.5 years old.

The top 5 provinces with more coronavirus cases are Gyeonggi-do, Seul, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Chungcheongbuk-do and Busan.

South Korea has demonstrated to mitigate really fast the spread of coronavirus. On average, it takes for them 3 days, from the day a person shows symptoms, to confirm they have coronavirus. Even some people were confirmed that they had coronavirus before they show any symptoms.

Approximately on the 2020-02-21, the number of total cases starts increasing linearly until 2020-04-21. After that, the rate of change slows down.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on getting insights of the data in order to see where to allocate resources to fight coronavirus. I start trying to understand how people are getting infected (contact, crowded places, overseas inflow?). One person can infect up to 51 people so it is important isolation.

Afterwards, I introduce the number of cases and the average age of infected people of each province divided by state and sex. For that I have used a heatmap.
